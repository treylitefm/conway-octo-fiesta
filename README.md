# Conway's Game of Life
What's up, and welcome to my very own Game of Life animation. If you'd like to run it, go ahead and clone this repo, then run:

    python conway-animation.py 

The rules, an interactive animation and a little backstory can all be found [here].

## Running the unittests
Easy! Simply run:

    python -m unittest discover tests 

## Bonus

John Conway is an awesome mathematician. Feel free to read up on him on [wikipedia]. Personally, my favorite concotion of his is the [Doomsday algorithm]. Cool party trick, no?
